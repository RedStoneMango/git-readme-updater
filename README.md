# üìù Git README Updater

### ‚ùó This repository is still in active development. Features may change, and bugs may exist. ‚ùó

Git README Updater (`gru`) is a collection of Bash scripts that let you **dynamically build and update README files locally**, and optionally **link them to remote Git repositories for automatic pushing and updating**. Whether you want to generate up-to-date README sections on your machine or automate updates directly in remote repositories, this tool provides a simple CLI workflow for both.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does

- **Build your README locally** by defining editable sections and inserting dynamic content using templates.  
- **Link your local setup to a remote Git repository** so you can commit and push README changes automatically.  
- Manage multiple README targets and repositories with ease.  

This makes it perfect for maintaining your profile README, project dashboards, or any documentation that changes frequently.

## üöÄ Installation

> **Note:** These scripts are designed for **Unix-based systems** only.

### üîß Automatic Installation

Run the following one-liner to install the updater and all required dependencies:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redstonemango/git-readme-updater/main/install.sh | bash -s -- /DESIRED/INSTALLATION/PATH
```

üìå Replace `/DESIRED/INSTALLATION/PATH` with the directory where you‚Äôd like the scripts to be installed. Missing directories will be created automatically.

The installation script will:
- Install required dependencies (`jq`, `git`)
- Download the script files
- Create symbolic links in your `$PATH`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You may need **elevated privileges** to install dependencies and create symlinks in system paths.

---

### üõ† Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RedStoneMango/git-readme-updater.git
   ```
   If `git` is not installed yet, install it (required for script functionality and installation process).

2. Ensure the target directory is writable, for the configuration files will be stored there.

3. Install `jq`, a lightweight and flexible JSON processor (required for script functionality).

4. Optionally, create symbolic links to the `.sh` script files in a directory listed in your `$PATH` to run them from anywhere.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All scripts have to be located in the same directory. This directory has to be read-/writable when executing the script.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Overview

`gru` has modular commands to manage targets (local or remote), write section content, and build/push your README files.

| Command Group | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `gru-target`  | Manage local README files and link remote repositories for automatic updates |
| `gru-writer`  | Add, update, or erase content in logical README sections |
| `gru-worker`  | Build README from templates locally, and push updates to remote repositories |

---

### How to Use

1. **Set up a target:**

   - To **work locally only**, register a README file without linking a remote repository.  
   - To **automatically update a remote Git repository**, register a target and link it to the repository and branch.

2. **Write or update content sections** in the README.

3. **Build your README locally** from a template file, which will replace placeholders with your dynamic content.

4. (Optional) **Push your updated README automatically** to the linked remote repository.

### üí° Example Workflow for Remote Auto-Update

**Goal:** Automatically update the "Current Projects" section in a remote repository's README.

1. **Register the remote README file as a target:**
   ```bash
   gru-target add "johnDoe/johnDoe:main" "/README.md" "ProfileRm"
   ```

2. **Select the target:**
   ```bash
   gru-target select "ProfileRm"
   ```

3. **Write a new project entry:**
   ```bash
   gru-writer write "- Personal website" "Website" "Projects"
   ```

4. **Create a README template:**

   `template.md`:
   ```
   # John Doe

   I'm a fictional programmer for explaining "gru"

   *My current projects are:*
   {@Projects}
   ```

5. **Build the new README locally:**
   ```bash
   gru-worker build "./template.md" "./builtReadme.md"
   ```

   Output (`builtReadme.md`):
   ```
   # John Doe

   I'm a fictional programmer for explaining "gru"

   *My current projects are:*
   - Personal website
   ```

6. **Push the updated README automatically to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   gru-worker remote-update "./builtReadme.md" --message "Updated project list"
   ```

---

### üí° Example Workflow for Local-Only Build

**Goal:** Build and update a README locally without linking to a remote repository.

1. **Register a local README file as a target (no remote repo linked):**
   ```bash
   gru-target add "local-readme" "/path/to/README.md"
   ```

2. **Select the target:**
   ```bash
   gru-target select "local-readme"
   ```

3. **Write a new section entry:**
   ```bash
   gru-writer write "- Local project" "LocalProject" "Projects"
   ```

4. **Build the README locally:**
   ```bash
   gru-worker build "./template.md" "./builtReadme.md"
   ```

In this workflow, no remote push occurs‚Äîyou manually manage the README file after building.

## üìñ Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Target** | A reference to a specific file in a Git repository (user/repo:branch + path). Commands operate on these targets. |
| **Writer** | Manages section content. Changes are stored in configuration until a build is triggered. |
| **Section** | Logical segments of a README (e.g., ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù, ‚ÄúTech Stack‚Äù) to be dynamically populated. |
| **Template** | A file with placeholders like `{@Projects}` that get replaced with actual data during the build. |
| **Build** | The process of rendering a README by replacing placeholders in a template with content from the `writer`. |

---

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Unix-based OS
