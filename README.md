# üìù Git README Updater

### ‚ùó This repository is not finished yet. I'm actively developing this tool and will be done as soon as possible ‚ùó

A collection of Bash scripts to **dynamically update sections in README files** with ease. Automate README updates across multiple (remote) repositories using a simple CLI toolchain.

---

## üöÄ Installation

> **Note:** These scripts are designed for **Unix-based systems** only.

### üîß Automatic Installation

Run the following one-liner to install the updater and all required dependencies:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redstonemango/git-readme-updater/main/install.sh | bash -s -- /DESIRED/INSTALLATION/PATH
```

üìå Replace `/DESIRED/INSTALLATION/PATH` with the directory where you‚Äôd like the scripts to be installed. Missing directories will be created automatically.

The installation script will:
- Install required dependencies (`jq`, `git`)
- Download the script files
- Create symbolic links in your `$PATH`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You may need **elevated privileges** to install dependencies and create symlinks in system paths.

---

### üõ† Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RedStoneMango/git-readme-updater.git
   ```
   If `git` is not installed yet, install it (required for script functionality and instalation process).

2. Ensure the target directory is writable, for the configuration files will be stored there.

3. Install `jq`, a lightweight and flexible JSON processor (required for script functionality).

4. Optionally, create symbolic links to the `.sh` script files in a directory listed in your `$PATH` to run them from anywhere.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All scripts have to be located in the same directory. This directory has to be read-/writable when executing the script.

### üí° Example Workflow

**Goal:** Automatically update the "Current Projects" section in a GitHub profile README.

1. **Register the README file as a target:**
   ```bash
   gru-target add "JohnDoe/JohnDoe:main" "/README.md" "ProfileRm"
   ```

2. **Select the target:**
   ```bash
   gru-target select "ProfileRm"
   ```

3. **Write a new project entry:**
   ```bash
   gru-writer write "- Personal website" "Website" "Projects"
   ```

4. **Create a README template:**

   `template.md`:
   ```
   # John Doe

   I'm a fictional programmer for explaining "gru"

   *My current projects are:*
   {@Projects}
   ```

5. **Build the new README:**
   ```bash
   gru-worker build "./template.md" "./builtReadme.md"
   ```

   Output `(builtReadme.md)`:
   ```
   # John Doe

   I'm a fictional programmer for explaining "gru"

   *My current projects are:*
   - Personal website
   ```

6. **Update the linked remote repository:**
   ```bash
   gru-worker remote-update "./builtReadme.md" --message "Updated project list"
   ```

## üìñ Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Target** | A reference to a specific file in a GitHub repository (user/repo:branch + path). Commands operate on these targets. |
| **Writer** | Manages section content. Changes are stored in configuration until a build is triggered. |
| **Section** | Logical segments of a README (e.g., ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù, ‚ÄúTech Stack‚Äù) to be dynamically populated. |
| **Template** | A file with placeholders like `{@Projects}` that get replaced with actual data during the build. |
| **Build** | The process of rendering a README by replacing placeholders in a template with content from the `writer`. |
